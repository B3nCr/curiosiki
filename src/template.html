                        <strong>William Shakespeare</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>William Shakespeare (/ˈʃeɪkspɪər/;[1] 26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616)[nb 1] was an English
                        poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the
                        world's pre-eminent dramatist.[2] He is often called England's national poet and the &quot;Bard of
                        Avon&quot;.[3][nb 2] His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays,[nb
                        3] 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His
                        plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those
                        of any other playwright.[4]</p> -->
